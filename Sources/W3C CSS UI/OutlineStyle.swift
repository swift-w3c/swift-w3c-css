/// The CSS `outline-style` property sets the style of an element's outline.
///
/// An outline is a line that is drawn around an element, outside the border.
/// Unlike borders, outlines don't affect layout and can be non-rectangular.
///
/// Example:
/// ```swift
/// .outlineStyle(.none)     // outline-style: none
/// .outlineStyle(.dotted)   // outline-style: dotted
/// .outlineStyle(.solid)    // outline-style: solid
/// .outlineStyle(.groove)   // outline-style: groove
/// ```
