/// The CSS `forced-color-adjust` property allows authors to opt certain elements out of
/// forced colors mode, which is an accessibility feature that limits the color palette.
///
/// This property is important for internationalization as it helps ensure that content
/// remains accessible to users with specific color perception needs, while still allowing
/// essential color information to be preserved when necessary.
///
/// Example:
/// ```swift
/// .forcedColorAdjust(.auto)                  // forced-color-adjust: auto
/// .forcedColorAdjust(.none)                  // forced-color-adjust: none
/// .forcedColorAdjust(.preserveParentColor)   // forced-color-adjust: preserve-parent-color
/// ```
///
/// - Note: This property should only be used to make changes that support a user's
///         color and contrast requirements. It should not be used to prevent user choices
///         from being respected.
///
/// - SeeAlso: [MDN Web Docs on forced-color-adjust](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/forced-color-adjust)
