/// The CSS `unicode-bidi` property, together with the `direction` property, determines how bidirectional text
/// in a document is handled.
///
/// For example, if a block of content contains both left-to-right and right-to-left text,
/// the user-agent uses a complex Unicode algorithm to decide how to display the text.
/// The `unicode-bidi` property overrides this algorithm and allows the developer to control the text embedding.
///
/// - Note: The `unicode-bidi` and `direction` properties are the only properties that are not affected
///         by the `all` shorthand.
///
/// - Warning: This property is intended for Document Type Definition (DTD) designers.
///            Web designers and similar authors should not override it.
///
/// - SeeAlso: [MDN Web Docs on unicode-bidi](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/unicode-bidi)
public enum UnicodeBidi: Property {

    /// The element does not offer an additional level of embedding with respect to the bidirectional algorithm.
    /// For inline elements, implicit reordering works across element boundaries.
    case normal

    /// If the element is inline, this value opens an additional level of embedding with respect to
    /// the bidirectional algorithm. The direction of this embedding level is given by the direction property.
    case embed

    /// For inline elements this creates an override. For block container elements this creates an
    /// override for inline-level descendants not within another block container element.
    case bidiOverride

    /// This keyword indicates that the element's container directionality should be calculated
    /// without considering the content of this element. The element is therefore isolated from its siblings.
    case isolate

    /// This keyword applies the isolation behavior of the isolate keyword to the surrounding content
    /// and the override behavior of the bidi-override keyword to the inner content.
    case isolateOverride

    /// This keyword makes the elements directionality calculated without considering its parent bidirectional
    /// state or the value of the direction property.
