/// The CSS `text-combine-upright` property sets the combination of characters into the space
/// of a single character.
///
/// If the combined text is wider than 1em, the user agent must fit the contents within 1em.
/// The resulting composition is treated as a single upright glyph for layout and decoration.
/// This property only has an effect in vertical writing modes.
///
/// This is used to produce an effect that is known as tate-chū-yoko (縦中横) in Japanese,
/// or as 橫向文字 in Chinese.
///
/// Example:
/// ```swift
/// .textCombineUpright(.none)       // text-combine-upright: none
/// .textCombineUpright(.all)        // text-combine-upright: all
/// .textCombineUpright(.digits(2))  // text-combine-upright: digits 2
/// ```
