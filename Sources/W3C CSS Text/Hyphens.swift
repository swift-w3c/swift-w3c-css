/// The CSS `hyphens` property specifies how words should be hyphenated when text wraps across multiple lines.
///
/// It can prevent hyphenation entirely, hyphenate at manually-specified points within the text,
/// or let the browser automatically insert hyphens where appropriate.
///
/// - Note: Hyphenation rules are language-specific. In HTML, the language is determined by the `lang` attribute,
///         and browsers will hyphenate only if this attribute is present and the appropriate hyphenation
///         dictionary is available.
///
/// - Note: The rules defining how hyphenation is performed are not explicitly defined by the specification,
///         so the exact hyphenation may vary from browser to browser.
///
/// - SeeAlso: [MDN Web Docs on hyphens](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/hyphens)
