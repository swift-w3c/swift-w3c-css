/// The CSS `overflow-wrap` property applies to text, setting whether the browser should insert
/// line breaks within an otherwise unbreakable string to prevent text from overflowing its line box.
///
/// In contrast to `word-break`, `overflow-wrap` will only create a break if an entire word cannot
/// be placed on its own line without overflowing.
///
/// Example:
/// ```swift
/// .overflowWrap(.normal)     // overflow-wrap: normal
/// .overflowWrap(.anywhere)   // overflow-wrap: anywhere
/// .overflowWrap(.breakWord)  // overflow-wrap: break-word
/// ```
///
/// - Note: This property was originally a nonstandard Microsoft extension called `word-wrap`,
///         and was implemented by most browsers with the same name. It has since been renamed
///         to `overflow-wrap`, with `word-wrap` being an alias.
///
/// - SeeAlso: [MDN Web Docs on overflow-wrap](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/overflow-wrap)

    /// Soft wrap opportunities introduced by the word break are considered when calculating min-content intrinsic sizes.
