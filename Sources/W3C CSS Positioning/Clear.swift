/// The CSS `clear` property sets whether an element must be moved below (cleared) floating elements that precede it.
/// The clear property applies to floating and non-floating elements.
///
/// Example:
/// ```swift
/// .clear(.none)          // clear: none
/// .clear(.left)          // clear: left
/// .clear(.right)         // clear: right
/// .clear(.both)          // clear: both
/// .clear(.inlineStart)   // clear: inline-start
/// .clear(.inlineEnd)     // clear: inline-end
/// ```
///
/// When applied to non-floating blocks, it moves the border edge of the element down until it is below the margin edge
/// of all relevant floats. This affects the position of later elements in the document flow.
///
/// - Note: If an element contains only floated elements, its height collapses to nothing.
///         You can prevent this by setting `display: flow-root` on the container.
///
/// - SeeAlso: [MDN Web Docs on clear](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/clear)
