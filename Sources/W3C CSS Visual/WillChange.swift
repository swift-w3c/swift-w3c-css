/// The CSS `will-change` property hints to browsers how an element is expected to change.
///
/// This allows browsers to set up optimizations before an element is actually changed,
/// potentially increasing responsiveness by doing expensive work before it's actually required.
///
/// - Warning: `will-change` is intended to be used as a last resort, in order to deal with existing
///            performance problems. It should not be used to anticipate performance problems.
///
/// Proper usage guidelines:
/// - Don't apply to too many elements
/// - Use sparingly
/// - Don't use for premature optimization
/// - Give the browser sufficient time to apply optimizations
/// - Be aware that it may influence visual appearance by creating a stacking context
///
/// - SeeAlso: [MDN Web Docs on will-change](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/will-change)
