/// The CSS `object-fit` property sets how the content of a replaced element, such as an
/// `<img>` or `<video>`, should be resized to fit its container.
///
/// Example:
/// ```swift
/// .objectFit(.contain)     // object-fit: contain
/// .objectFit(.cover)       // object-fit: cover
/// .objectFit(.fill)        // object-fit: fill
/// .objectFit(.none)        // object-fit: none
/// .objectFit(.scaleDown)   // object-fit: scale-down
/// ```
///
/// - Note: This property applies only to replaced elements, and has no effect on elements
///         like `<iframe>`, `<embed>`, and `<fencedframe>`.
/// - Note: You can alter the alignment of the replaced element's content object within
///         the element's box using the `object-position` property.
///
